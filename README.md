# AI_Reserach_Project
This project is using the white wine quality dataset using the classification models

Abstract:
This project involves using a classification model for the Wine Quality dataset to evaluate the potential of PyCaret. Classification is one of the critical concepts of machine learning.An automated machine-learning library is used to build and optimize classification models. This project involves preprocessing the data, comparing multiple models, analyzing various hyperparameters, and analyzing results using various graphs, such as confusion matrix and feature importance plots. The findings observed using the PyCaret library in the notebook provide valuable insights for future applications and predictive modelling.
